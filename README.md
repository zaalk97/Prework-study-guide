## Installation
Installing this project required me to first create the webpage using HTML in Visual Studio Code. I used this program to add details to make the webpage more appealing and easy to access.

JavaScript was used to create a tool to select which topic to study. 

## Usage
Use this Prework Study guide as reference material. Key points from each topic have been included. Check which topic you are trying to learn about and read the information below the heading.

Right-Click and 'Inspect' the page to view the console to find which topic to study first!
